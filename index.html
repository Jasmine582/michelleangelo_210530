      content=" New book out now called Unapologetically Misunderstood! Unapologetically Misunderstood is a tantalizing novel centered around Jonae, the main character, and her complicated relationships with her mother and a wealthy businessman whom she believes is potentially her future. She yearns to be loved, but she begins to question everyone's loyalty after she discovers mind-spiraling secrets and is left to decide if she will surrender to her lustful cravings, make a complete break away from the life she has come to know, or boss up and be the woman that's she's worked so hard to become."
